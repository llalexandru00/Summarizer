            <h1>Summarizer</h1>
            <h2>
                Insert here the text which is going to be summarized. Make sure it fits the linguistic standards: end propositions with
                dot and space, let at least one space before the start of one word etc. Afterwards, choosing the quick submit will result in
                loading a page with the final result, which can't be anymore altered. On the other hand, choosing the submit option will
                load a configuration page, in order to feedback the result, thus altering the process. Finally, you can choose the ratio at
                which the text will be summarized (99 will mean no summarization). {{name}}
