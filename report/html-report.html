        <h1> 1. Introduction </h1>
        <p> 
            <b>Summarizer</b> is a tool used for summerizing texts somewhere around 10%-50% of the initial content.  Specific euristics and plain algorithms
            are used for identifying relevant content which should definatley appear in the summary. In other words, words/sentences/paragraphs which do not
            bring value to the semantic will be removed in order to shorten the text. The user is also playing a role in feedbacking the algorithm for better
            performance.
        </p>

    <section id="architecture">
        <h1> 2. Project architecture </h1>
        <p> The arhitecure will be modeled in a C4 model. Even if the context is not very strong, the containers and the components are worth mentioning in a such fashion.  </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Context</b> Summarizer is represented by a single context - the Summarizer system. This makes sense while this web application is
                currently independent from any other existing systems like external API's or cloud services. However, this doesn't mean it is not open
                for extension; the current implementation will focus more on the internal backbone.</li>
            <li><b>Container </b> The atchitecure is built around 3 containers mainly evoking the separation concept principle. The One-Page application
                is the physical interpretation of the front-end, delivering to the user a way of inputing the parameters and the data itself. Also this 
                directly provides the user a dashboard to customize the decisions of the AI (giving feedback).  </li>
            <li><b>Component </b> The components represent how the use-cases are modeled. Starting front the front-end side, there are 3 main stages which
                the user should pursue. Firstly it should plug in the data and eventually cusomize the parameters. If it opts for an advanced summary, it
                will be led to the 2nd stage, the dashboard. Here he can customize the AI and tinker the result such that it gives feedback to the summarizer.
                In the end, the user will get his summary. In the background, the API will be called withing the parameters provided to obtain a response.
            </li>
            <li><b>Code</b> No code scheme is yet figured. As a regular application, this is not appropriate for a summary of the architecture.</li>

        <h5 id="be_1_1"> 4.1.1 Sentence trimming </h5>
        <p> The sentence trimming will deal with finding an euristic which will define how relevant one sentence is. Separating the concepts into sentances
            we ensure that removing one will not trigger semantic loss. However, the naive trimming can change the semantic, mainly if several sentances are
            semantically related. All in all, the score given to each sentance will be given according to some parameters: the words it contains, the length of it,
            the link to the neightbor sentances etc. Depending on this score, the sentances may be even merged to ensure than it will make sence afterwards as well.
        </p>
        <h5 id="be_1_2"> 4.1.2 Abbreviation and synonyms </h5>
        <p> Another way of safe summarizing is to replace long words with shorter one without losing meaning. The safest approach is to stuff in abbreviations (ex:
            Articial Inteligence will be summarized in A.I.). The synonum approach is still not 100% safe, as it can replace words which are part of one expression,
            thus it should keep the same syntax. As a naive approach this will be ignored, but further on, a score will be given to such replacements, thus synonyms
            which are riskier will be used in extreme cases (high compression level).
        </p>
        <h5 id="be_1_3"> 4.1.3 Word merging </h5>
        <p> For the sake of content lenght, some words can be merged in order to obtain a compressed version. This will be mainly handled in cases, such that it won't
            risk the lose of semantic. Thus there will be certain pre-defined scenarios in which the compression will be done. Also, based on the risk of applying such 
            rule, these replacements will be evaluated to a score (as before). An example is negating words: "not good" should be replaced with "bad".
        </p>
        <h3 id="be_1_4"> 4.2 Feedback </h3>
        <p> The user is allowed to provide a feedback, which will be interpreted as scores, which will trigger another summarize, depending on the new parameters.
            This will help in cases in which the user tells that some sentances are crucial, thus the words in it may prove important, thus the API might reconsider
            trimming sentances with these words. Also, the merging or abbreviations can be silenced by the user, meaning that there is a lost of semantic in those: which
            should trigger score recalculation.
